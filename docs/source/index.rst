Welcome to PySoccer's documentation!
====================================
**PySoccer**  is a Python API for mining and extracting natural language text
from source code at entity level. The programming language construct (such as 
package, class, method, etc.,) is referred to as *entity*. For now, PySoccer
supports only Java programming language i.e., it can mine and extract entity
level natural language text and attributes from Java projects, for example:
package level, class level, interface level, method level, static block level 
source code comments and multiple associated attributes can be mined. Further,
the mined comments and attributes can be used in other python programs through
API support.
